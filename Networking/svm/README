     Support Vector Machines Implementation
================================================

This is an implementation of svm, and I employed the algorithm in [1] to
solve the following optimization problem:
------------------------------------------------
min 0.5*alpha^T * Q * alpha - e^T * alpha
s.t. 
     0 <= alpha[i] <= C     i = 1,...,m
     y^T * alpha = 0
------------------------------------------------
The algorithm is a combination of SMO[2] and SVM-light[3] and it is very 
simple, graceful:) and efficient.

1. What's in this package?
  - src: the source code
  - bin: the executable binary
  - doc: svm reading list and the developers munual
  - app: an gender detector which can detect the gender of an Chinese name

2. Enviroment
  The code is written in C++ under Windows Cygwin.
